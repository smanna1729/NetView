<blockquote> <font size="4">The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the 
    core protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite. TCP is one of the two original 
    components of the suite, complementing the Internet Protocol (IP), and therefore 
    the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP provides reliable, ordered 
    delivery of a stream of bytes from a program on one computer to another program 
    on another computer. TCP is the protocol that major Internet applications such 
    as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration and file transfer rely on.</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Source port (16 bits)</b> : identifies the sending port.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Destination port (16 bits)</b> : identifies the receiving port.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Sequence number (32 bits)</b> : has a dual role.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">If the SYN flag is set (1), then this is the initial sequence number. 
    The sequence number of the actual first data byte and the acknowledged number in 
    the corresponding ACK are then this sequence number plus 1.<br><br>
    If the SYN flag is clear (0), then this is the accumulated sequence number of the 
    first data byte of this packet for the current session.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Acknowledgment number (32 bits) :</b> if the ACK flag is set then the 
    value of this field is the next sequence number that the receiver is expecting. 
    This acknowledges receipt of all prior bytes (if any). The first ACK sent by each 
    end acknowledges the other end's initial sequence number itself, but no data.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Data offset (4 bits) :</b> specifies the size of the TCP header in 32-bit 
    words. The minimum size header is 5 words and the maximum is 15 words thus giving the 
    minimum size of 20 bytes and maximum of 60 bytes, allowing for up to 40 bytes of options 
    in the header. This field gets its name from the fact that it is also the offset from the 
    start of the TCP segment to the actual data.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Reserved (3 bits) :</b> for future use and should be set to zero.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Flags (9 bits) (aka Control bits) :</b> contains 9 1-bit flags.<br>
    <br><b>NS (1 bit) :</b> ECN-nonce concealment protection (added to header by RFC 3540).
    <br><b>CWR (1 bit) :</b> Congestion Window Reduced (CWR) flag is set by the sending host to 
    indicate that it received a TCP segment with the ECE flag set and had responded in 
    congestion control mechanism (added to header by RFC 3168).
    <br><b>ECE (1 bit) :</b> ECN-Echo indicates.
    <br>If the SYN flag is set (1), that the TCP peer is ECN capable. If the SYN flag is 
        clear (0), that a packet with Congestion Experienced flag in IP header set is 
        received during normal transmission (added to header by RFC 3168).
    <br><b>URG (1 bit) :</b> indicates that the Urgent pointer field is significant.
    <br><b>ACK (1 bit) :</b> indicates that the Acknowledgment field is significant. All packets 
    after the initial SYN packet sent by the client should have this flag set.
    <br><b>PSH (1 bit) :</b> Push function. Asks to push the buffered data to the receiving application.
    <br><b>RST (1 bit) :</b> Reset the connection
    <br><b>SYN (1 bit) :</b> Synchronize sequence numbers. Only the first packet sent from each end 
    should have this flag set. Some other flags change meaning based on this flag, and some 
    are only valid for when it is set, and others when it is clear.
    <br><b>FIN (1 bit) :</b> No more data from sender</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Window size (16 bits) :</b> the size of the receive window, which 
    specifies the number of bytes (beyond the sequence number in the acknowledgment field) 
    that the receiver is currently willing to receive (see Flow control and Window Scaling).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Checksum (16 bits) :</b> The 16-bit checksum field is used for 
    error-checking of the header and data.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Urgent pointer (16 bits) :</b> if the URG flag is set, then this 16-bit 
    field is an offset from the sequence number indicating the last urgent data byte.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Options (Variable 0-320 bits, divisible by 32) :</b> The length of 
    this field is determined by the data offset field. Options have up to three fields: 
    Option-Kind (1 byte), Option-Length (1 byte), Option-Data (variable). The Option-Kind 
    field indicates the type of option, and is the only field that is not optional. 
    Depending on what kind of option we are dealing with, the next two fields may be set: 
    the Option-Length field indicates the total length of the option, and the Option-Data 
    field contains the value of the option, if applicable. For example, an Option-Kind 
    byte of 0x01 indicates that this is a No-Op option used only for padding, and does 
    not have an Option-Length or Option-Data byte following it. An Option-Kind byte of 0 
    is the End Of Options option, and is also only one byte. An Option-Kind byte of 0x02 
    indicates that this is the Maximum Segment Size option, and will be followed by a byte 
    specifying the length of the MSS field (should be 0x04). Note that this length is 
    the total length of the given options field, including Option-Kind and Option-Length 
    bytes. So while the MSS value is typically expressed in two bytes, the length of the 
    field will be 4 bytes (+2 bytes of kind and length). In short, an MSS option field 
    with a value of 0x05B4 will show up as (0x02 0x04 0x05B4) in the TCP options section.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Padding :</b> The TCP header padding is used to ensure that the TCP 
    header ends and data begins on a 32 bit boundary. The padding is composed of zeros.</font></p>
