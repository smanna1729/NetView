    <p><font size="4">Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth revision in 
	  the development of the Internet Protocol (IP) and the first version of the protocol 
	  to be widely deployed. Together with IPv6, it is at the core of standards-based 
	  internetworking methods of the Internet. IPv4 is still by far the most widely 
	  deployed Internet Layer protocol (As of 2011, IPv6 deployment is still in its 
	  infancy). </font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="4"><b>Packet structure : </b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">An IP packet consists of a header section and a data section. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><b>Header :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">The IPv4 packet header consists of 14 fields, of which 13 are 
	  required. The 14th field is optional (red background in table) and aptly named: 
	  options. The fields in the header are packed with the most significant byte first 
	  (big endian), and for the diagram and discussion, the most significant bits are 
	  considered to come first (MSB 0 bit numbering). The most significant bit is numbered 0, 
	  so the version field is actually found in the four most significant bits of the first 
	  byte.</font></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="4"><b>Version :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">The first header field in an IP packet is the four-bit version field. 
	   For IPv4, this has a value of 4 (hence the name IPv4).</font></p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Internet Header Length (IHL) :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">The second field (4 bits) is the Internet Header Length (IHL) telling 
	  the number of 32-bit words in the header. Since an IPv4 header may contain a variable 
	  number of options, this field specifies the size of the header (this also coincides with 
	  the offset to the data). The minimum value for this field is 5 (RFC 791), which is a length 
	  of 5×32 = 160 bits = 20 bytes. Being a 4-bit value, the maximum length is 15 words (15×32 bits) 
	  or 480 bits = 60 bytes.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>TOS (Type of Services) :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4"><i>Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) :</i><br>
	  Originally defined as the Type of Service field, this field is now defined by RFC 2474 for 
	  Differentiated services (DiffServ). New technologies are emerging that require real-time data 
	  streaming and therefore make use of the DSCP field. An example is Voice over IP (VoIP) that is 
	  used for interactive data voice exchange.<br><br>
	  <i>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) :</i><br>
	  Defined in RFC 3168 and allows end-to-end notification of network congestion without dropping 
	  packets. ECN is an optional feature that is only used when both endpoints support it and are 
	  willing to use it. It is only effective when supported by the underlying network.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><b>Total Length :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">This 16-bit field defines the entire datagram size, including header and data, 
	  in bytes. The minimum-length datagram is 20 bytes (20-byte header + 0 bytes data) and the 
	  maximum is 65,535 bytes - the maximum value of a 16-bit word. The maximum size datagram that 
	  any host is required to be able to handle is 576 bytes, but most modern hosts handle much larger 
	  packets. Sometimes subnetworks impose further restrictions on the size, in which case datagrams 
	  must be fragmented. Fragmentation is handled in either the host or packet switch in IPv4.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Identification :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">This field is an identification field and is primarily used for uniquely 
	  identifying fragments of an original IP datagram. Some experimental work has suggested using the 
	  ID field for other purposes, such as for adding packet-tracing information to datagrams in order 
	  to help trace back datagrams with spoofed source addresses.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Flags :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">A three-bit field follows and is used to control or identify fragments. They are 
	  (in order, from high order to low order):<br>
	  <b>bit 0:</b> Reserved; must be zero.<br>
	  <b>bit 1:</b> Don't Fragment (DF)<br>
	  <b>bit 2:</b> More Fragments (MF)<br>
	  If the DF flag is set and fragmentation is required to route the packet then the packet is dropped. 
	  This can be used when sending packets to a host that does not have sufficient resources to handle 
	  fragmentation. It can also be used for Path MTU Discovery, either automatically by the host IP 
	  software, or manually using diagnostic tools such as ping or traceroute.<br>
	  For unfragmented packets, the MF flag is cleared. For fragmented packets, all fragments except the 
	  last have the MF flag set. The last fragment has a non-zero Fragment Offset field, differentiating 
	  it from an unfragmented packet.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Fragment Offset :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">The fragment offset field, measured in units of eight-byte blocks, is 13 bits long 
	  and specifies the offset of a particular fragment relative to the beginning of the original 
	  unfragmented IP datagram. The first fragment has an offset of zero. This allows a maximum offset of 
	  (213 - 1) × 8 = 65,528 bytes which would exceed the maximum IP packet length of 65,535 bytes with 
	  the header length included (65,528 + 20 = 65,548 bytes).</font></p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Time To Live (TTL) :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">An eight-bit time to live field helps prevent datagrams from persisting (e.g. going 
	  in circles) on an internet. This field limits a datagram's lifetime. It is specified in seconds, 
	  but time intervals less than 1 second are rounded up to 1. In latencies typical in practice, it has 
	  come to be a hop count field. Each router that a datagram crosses decrements the TTL field by one. 
	  When the TTL field hits zero, the packet is no longer forwarded by a packet switch and is discarded.
	  Typically, an ICMP Time Exceeded message is sent back to the sender to inform it that the packet has 
	  been discarded. The reception of these ICMP messages is at the heart of how traceroute works.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Protocol :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">This field defines the protocol used in the data portion of the IP datagram. The 
	  Internet Assigned Numbers Authority maintains a list of IP protocol numbers which was originally 
	  defined in RFC 790.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Header Checksum :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">The 16-bit checksum field is used for error-checking of the header. At each hop, 
	  the checksum of the header must be compared to the value of this field. If a header checksum is 
	  found to be mismatched, then the packet is discarded. Errors in the data field must be handled by 
	  the encapsulated protocol and both UDP and TCP have checksum fields. As the TTL field is 
	  decremented on each hop, a new checksum must be computed each time. <br><br>
	  <i>The method used to compute the checksum is defined by RFC 1071:</i><br><br>
	  The checksum field is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of all 16-bit words 
	  in the header. For purposes of computing the checksum, the value of the checksum field is zero.<br>
      For example, use Hex 4500003044224000800600008c7c19acae241e2b (20 bytes IP header):<br>
      4500 + 0030 + 4422 + 4000 + 8006 + 0000 + 8c7c + 19ac + ae24 + 1e2b = 2BBCF<br>
      2 + BBCF = BBD1 = 1011101111010001, the 1'S of sum = 0100010000101110 = 442E<br><br>
      To validate a header's checksum the same algorithm may be used - the checksum of a header which 
	  contains a correct checksum field is a word containing all zeros (value 0):<br>
      2BBCF + 442E = 2FFFD. 2 + FFFD = FFFF. the 1'S of FFFF = 0.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4"><b>Source address :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">An IPv4 address indicating the sender of the packet. Note that this address may be 
	  changed in transit by a network address translation device.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Destination address :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">An IPv4 address indicating the receiver of the packet. As with the Source address, 
	  this may be changed in transit by a network address translation device.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Options :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">Additional header fields may follow the destination address field, but these are 
	  not often used. Note that the value in the IHL field must include enough extra 32-bit words to hold 
	  all the options (plus any padding needed to ensure that the header contains an integral number of 
	  32-bit words). The list of options may be terminated with an EOL (End of Options List, 0x00) option; 
	  this is only necessary if the end of the options would not otherwise coincide with the end of the 
	  header. </font></p>
	<p><font size="4"><b>Data :</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4">The data portion of the packet is not included in the packet checksum. Its contents 
	  are interpreted based on the value of the Protocol header field.<br>
	  In a typical IP implementation, standard protocols such as TCP and UDP are implemented in the OS 
          kernel for performance reasons. Other protocols such as ICMP may be partially implemented by the 
          kernel, or implemented purely in user software. Protocols not implemented in-kernel, and not exposed 
          by standard APIs such as BSD sockets, are typically implemented using a 'raw socket' API.<br><br>
