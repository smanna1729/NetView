<blockquote>
  <p><font size="4">The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core members 
     of the Internet Protocol Suite, the set of network protocols used for the 
     Internet. With UDP, computer applications can send messages, in this case 
     referred to as datagrams, to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network 
     without requiring prior communications to set up special transmission channels 
     or data paths. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4">UDP uses a simple transmission model without implicit handshaking 
     dialogues for providing reliability, ordering, or data integrity. Thus, UDP 
     provides an unreliable service and datagrams may arrive out of order, appear 
     duplicated, or go missing without notice. UDP assumes that error checking and 
     correction is either not necessary or performed in the application, avoiding the 
     overhead of such processing at the network interface level. Time-sensitive 
     applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for 
     delayed packets, which may not be an option in a real-time system. UDP's stateless 
     nature is also useful for servers answering small queries from huge numbers of 
     clients. </font></p>
  <p><font size="4"> The UDP header consists of 4 fields, each of which is 2 bytes 
     (16 bits). The use of two of those is optional in IPv4 (pink background in table). 
     In IPv6 only the source port is optional.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="4"><b>Source port number :</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="4">This field identifies the sender's port when meaningful and should 
     be assumed to be the port to reply to if needed. If not used, then it should be 
     zero. If the source host is the client, the port number is likely to be an ephemeral 
     port number. If the source host is the server, the port number is likely to be a 
     well-known port number.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="4"><b>Destination port number :</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="4">This field identifies the receiver's port and is required. Similar 
     to source port number, if the client is the destination host then the port number 
     will likely be an ephemeral port number and if the destination host is the server 
     then the port number will likely be a well-known port number.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="4"><b>Length :</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="4">A field that specifies the length in bytes of the entire datagram: 
     header and data. The minimum length is 8 bytes since that's the length of the header. 
     The field size sets a theoretical limit of 65,535 bytes (8 byte header + 65,527 bytes 
     of data) for a UDP datagram. The practical limit for the data length which is imposed 
     by the underlying IPv4 protocol is 65,507 bytes (65,535 - 8 byte UDP header - 20 byte 
     IP header).</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="4"><b>Checksum :</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="4">The checksum field is used for error-checking of the header and data. 
     If no checksum is generated by the transmitter, the field uses the value all-zeros. 
     This field is not optional for IPv6.<br><br>
     The method used to compute the checksum is defined in RFC 768:<br><br>
     <i>Checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of a pseudo header 
     of information from the IP header, the UDP header, and the data, padded with zero octets 
     at the end (if necessary) to make a multiple of two octets.</i><br><br>In other words, all 
     16-bit words are summed using one's complement arithmetic. The sum is then one's
     complemented to yield the value of the UDP checksum field.<br><br>If the checksum calculation
     results in the value zero (all 16 bits 0) it should be sent as the one's complement 
     (all 1s).</font></p>
