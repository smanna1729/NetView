  <blockquote>
   <p><font size="4">A data packet on an Ethernet link is called an Ethernet frame. 
   A frame begins with Preamble and Start Frame Delimiter. Following which, each 
   Ethernet frame continues with an Ethernet header featuring destination and source 
   MAC addresses. The middle section of the frame is payload data including any 
   headers for other protocols (e.g. Internet Protocol) carried in the frame. The 
   frame ends with a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check which is used to detect any 
   corruption of data in transit. </font></p>
   <p><font size="4">A Media Access Control address (MAC address) is a unique 
   identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical 
   network segment. MAC addresses are used for numerous network technologies and 
   most IEEE 802 network technologies, including Ethernet. Logically, MAC addresses 
   are used in the Media Access Control protocol sub-layer of the OSI reference model.
   </font></p>
   <p><font size="4">MAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of a 
   network interface card (NIC) and are stored in its hardware, the card's read-only 
   memory, or some other firmware mechanism. If assigned by the manufacturer, a MAC 
   address usually encodes the manufacturer's registered identification number and may 
   be referred to as the burned-in address. It may also be known as an Ethernet hardware 
   address (EHA), hardware address or physical address. A network node may have multiple 
   NICs and will then have one unique MAC address per NIC.</font></p>
