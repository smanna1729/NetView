Procedure to intall NetView+:
	
 Extract the 'NetView+.tar.gz'
 Kept in the specific folder.
 There are two script files – 'install' and 'run'
 Before using 'run' and 'install' you have to get the access  right of the root administrator.
 Using command line run 'chmod +x install' to make 'install' script file executable.
 Run the command './install' to install the software.
 Run the command './run' to run the software.
 You have to run the './install' command once and './run' each time whenever you want to run the software.
 If you have jvm in your computer and you are still unable to install, this is because the script file does not find the class path of the java library. Edit the 'install' script file to install it.
